# self-driving-car

This is a playground project. It utilizes neural network to navigate a car in traffic, simulated in JS. Initially based on https://github.com/gniziemazity/Self-driving-car

Currently adding randomized traffic, fitness function to evaluate performance (most likely based on the number of dummy cars passed by) and automated iteration

In long term planning to add variable sensor range (shorter for sides, longer for front), turns, changing number of lanes, crossroads, roadsigns, traffic lights, oncoming traffic
